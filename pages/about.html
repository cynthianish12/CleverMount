            CleverMount is a family-founded school that opened in November 2022.
            It is located in the Northern province of Rwanda, specifically in Rulindo district, Tumba Sector.
            Our family has always been passionate about education. Mugiraneza, our father, was a teacher in his youth, 
            and our passion for quality education in less privileged areas led us to establish the school. 
            Inspired by our daughters' (Anne and Cynthia ) experiences at boarding school and motivated by the desire 
            for our youngest son, Valentin, to have access to quality education without sacrificing precious family time as 
            a young boy, we embarked on this journey. Indeed, God used Valentin to ignite the passion we had as a family.
            Our goal is twofold: to provide quality education and benefit the community, addressing the challenges of family 
            separation for education and lack of quality education opportunities for many children in rural communities." 
            We believe that foundations are core and our call is to build solid foundations for future generations.
